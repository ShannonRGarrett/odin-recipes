    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Full transparency here- I have never been a fan of PB&Js. I will not just side
        and make myself that sandwhich; I prefer PB&Banana or PB&Honey. All that changed
        when I was introduced to the Grilled PB&J!<br>
        This sandwhich is like no other. So melty and warm! I eat it as a dessert!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White bread</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Jelly (whatever flavor you fancy)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make your PB&J as you normal would
            <ol>
                <li>Lay out your two slices of bread</li>
                <li>Place a good amount of Peanut Butter on one piece</li>
                <li>Jelly is placed on the other side</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>On a griddle, place butter in the shape of your bread (want enough for your whole piece of bread)</li>
        <li>Once the butter is place, put your made PB&J on the butter</li>
        <li>Let that grill that side of the sandwhich, then repeat the butter steps for the other side</li>

    </ol>
