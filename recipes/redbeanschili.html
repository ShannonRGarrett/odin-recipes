    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This recipe was founded the same way all great things are found... by chnace.
        It all started when my husband made the mistake of asking me to cook; you see
        I am not the chef in the family. Well I did what he asked me to do, which was
        chop up the sausage and the 'Holy Trinity' for the Red Beans and Rice that we were
        going to have. After that was done he told he it is like a 4 hour process and
        he had meetings that night so I would have to baby sit the meal. NOOO Thanks!
        Thats when he was like okay what else can we do??!
        <br><br>
        And so Red Beans Chili was born.
